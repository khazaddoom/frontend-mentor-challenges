## My process

- Mobile First Approach
- On a Careful look this doesnt need any desktop styles at all
- Since web is responsive by nature adjust styles to match both mobile and desktop designs.
- Fonts are usually "there is no one way to implement" kind of thing for me
- So for fonts i have gone "just basic imports" (could have hosted locally!)
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## Acknowledgments

- the rounded border matching exactly to the design could be a thing to be careful off!
- making the title and subtitle match the exact design specs could be challenging
